For all cases where the same reviewer rated the same movie twice and gave it a higher rating the second time, return the reviewer's name and the title of the movie. 

my first attempt ：
select name,title

太难了爆炸

solution on stackoverflow:

SELECT rev.name, m.title
FROM Reviewer rev
INNER JOIN Rating r1 on r1.rID = rev.rID
INNER JOIN Rating r2 on r2.rID = rev.rID and r2.mID = r1.mID
INNER JOIN Movie m on m.mID = r1.mID
WHERE r2.ratingDate > r1.ratingDate and r2.stars > r1.stars
