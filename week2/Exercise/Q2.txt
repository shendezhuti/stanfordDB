Find the names of all females who eat at least one pizza served by Straw Hat. (Note: The pizza need not be eaten at Straw Hat.) 


\project_{name} \select_{pizzeria='Straw Hat'} (eats \join (\select_{gender='female'} person) \join Serves);


为什么这里不是？？
\project_{name} (\select_{pizzeria='Straw Hat'} (eats \join (\select_{gender='female'} person) \join Serves));

外面的()不需要了？
