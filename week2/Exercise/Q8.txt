Find all pizzerias that only serve pizzas eaten by people over 30?


这个题有一点歧义？
	
			\project_{pizzeria}   (\select_{age>30}Person \join Eats); 


stackoverflow 上的答案：

\project_{pizzeria} Serves
\diff
\project_{pizzeria} (
Serves
\join
((\project_{pizza} Serves)
\diff
(\project_{pizza}((\select_{age>'30'} Person) \join Eats)))
)
