Find the age of the oldest person (or people) who eat mushroom pizza. (This query is quite challenging; congratulations if you get it right.) 

第一次的答案：
	\project_{age} (\select_{pizza='mushroom'} eats \join person);
显然上面的答案是错误的，没有选出最大值

看了discuss:Okay, i finally got it. You basically have to join on the ages with the argument age1>age2 and you get a long list where age2 always is smaller than age2 meaning the highest age is not included. Then you can just diff this from all ages and you get the maximum.

尝试了一下：搞出了45这个最大值
  \project_{age} person 
  \diff 
  \project_{age2}  \select_{age1>age2} ( \rename_{name,age1,gender}person \cross \rename_{name,age2,gender}person );
  


  (\project_{age} (\select_{pizza='mushroom'} eats \join person))

  \diff

  (\project_{age2}	\select_{age1>age2} ( \rename_{name,pizza,age1,gender} (\select_{pizza='mushroom'} eats \join person) 

  			  \cross

  			  \rename_{name,pizza,age2,gender} (\select_{pizza='mushroom'} eats \join person) ));
