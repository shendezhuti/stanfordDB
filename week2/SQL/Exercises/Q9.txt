Find the difference between the average rating of movies released before 1980 and the average rating of movies released after 1980. (Make sure to calculate the average rating for each movie, then the average of those averages for movies before 1980 and movies after. Don't just calculate the overall average rating before and after 1980.) 

my first attempt:
select (select mID,avg(stars)
from rating r,movie m
where r.mID=m.mID  
group by stars );


solution on stackoverflow:

select pre80s.avgRating - post80s.avgRating
from 
(
    select avg(indAvg) as avgRating
    from 
    (
        select avg(stars) as indAvg
        from Rating
        where mID in
            (
                select mID
                from Movie
                where year <= 1980
            )
        group by mID
    )
) as pre80s,
(
    select avg(indAvg) as avgRating
    from 
    (
        select avg(stars) as indAvg
        from Rating
        where mID not in
            (
                select mID
                from Movie
                where year <= 1980
            )
        group by mID
    )
) as post80s;
