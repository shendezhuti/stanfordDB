For each movie, return the title and the 'rating spread', that is, the difference between highest and lowest ratings given to that movie. Sort by rating spread from highest to lowest, then by movie title. 

my first attempt:
select m.title,  max(mx-mn) as rating spread
from (select title, max(stars)as mx, min(stars)as mn from rating r, movie m 
where r.mID=m.mID)
order by rating spread,title;


solution on stackoverflow:

SELECT Movie.title,  max(Rating.stars)-min(Rating.stars) as spread
FROM Movie, Rating
WHERE Movie.mID = Rating.mID
GROUP BY Rating.mID
ORDER BY spread DESC, Movie.title ASC
