Some directors directed more than one movie. For all such directors, return the titles of all movies directed by them, along with the director name. Sort by director name, then movie title. (As an extra challenge, try writing the query both with and without COUNT.) 

my attempt:
SELECT DISTINCT title,name
FROM Movie JOIN (Rating JOIN Reviewer USING(rID)) USING(mID)
group by name
having count(title)>=2
Order by name,title;

明显错了，题目没有申请，这个题目只需要用movie一个relation



select title,director 
from movie 
where director in
(
	select director 
	from movie
	group by director
	having count(director)>1
)
order by director, title;
