Find the movie(s) with the highest average rating. Return the movie title(s) and average rating. (Hint: This query is more difficult to write in SQLite than other systems; you might think of it as finding the highest average rating and then choosing the movie(s) with that average rating.) 


my attepmt:

selct title max(stars)
from (
select max(stars) 
from rating
where stars in (
select avg(stars)
from rating 
group by mID
) );

solution on github:

SELECT DISTINCT title, avgstars
FROM
(
SELECT DISTINCT title, AVG(stars) AS avgstars
FROM Movie JOIN (Rating JOIN Reviewer USING(rID)) USING(mID)
GROUP BY title
)
WHERE avgstars IN
(
SELECT DISTINCT MAX(avgstars)
FROM
(
SELECT DISTINCT title, AVG(stars) AS avgstars
FROM Movie JOIN (Rating JOIN Reviewer USING(rID)) USING(mID)
GROUP BY title
)
)
