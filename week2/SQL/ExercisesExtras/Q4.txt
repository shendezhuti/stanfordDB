Find the titles of all movies not reviewed by Chris Jackson. 


my first attempt:
select distinct title 
from movie join rating using (mID)  join reviewer using (rID)
where name  <> 'Chris Jackson';

为什么不行呢？？我感觉应该可以啊

solution on github:
SELECT title
FROM MOVIE
WHERE mID IN
(
SELECT DISTINCT mID
FROM Movie
EXCEPT
SELECT DISTINCT mID
FROM Rating JOIN Reviewer USING(rID)
WHERE Reviewer.name = 'Chris Jackson'
)
