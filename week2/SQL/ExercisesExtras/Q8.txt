Find the names of all reviewers who have contributed three or more ratings. (As an extra challenge, try writing the query without HAVING or without COUNT.) 

my attempt:
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM Movie JOIN (Rating JOIN Reviewer USING(rID)) USING(mID)
where count(rID) >3
group by rID;


solution on github:

SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM Movie JOIN (Rating JOIN Reviewer USING(rID)) USING(mID)
GROUP BY name
HAVING COUNT(stars) >= 3
