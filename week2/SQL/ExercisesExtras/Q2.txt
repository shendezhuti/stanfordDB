For any rating where the reviewer is the same as the director of the movie, return the reviewer name, movie title, and number of stars. 

my first attempt:

select rev.name,m.title, count(r.stars)
from raing r, reviewer rev,movie m
where rev.rID=r.rID and m.director=rev.name
group by r.mID

solution on github:

SELECT DISTINCT Reviewer.name, Movie.title, Rating.stars
FROM (Movie JOIN Rating USING(mID)) JOIN Reviewer USING(rID)
WHERE Movie.director = Reviewer.name
