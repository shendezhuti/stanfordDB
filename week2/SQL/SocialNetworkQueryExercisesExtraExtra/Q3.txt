For every pair of students who both like each other, return the name and grade of both students. Include each pair only once, with the two names in alphabetical order. 


my first attempt:
select distinct h1.name,h1.grade,h2.name,h2.grade
from Highschooler h1, Highschooler h2,Likes
where h1.ID=Likes.ID2 and h2.ID=Likes.ID1 and h1.name<h2.name;

这错误了

solution on github:
SELECT DISTINCT H1.name, H1.grade, H2.name, H2.grade
FROM Highschooler H1, Highschooler H2,
( SELECT DISTINCT L1.ID1, L1.ID2 FROM Likes L1,  Likes L2
WHERE L1.ID1 = L2.ID2 AND L1.ID2 = L2.ID1 ) Pairs
WHERE H1.ID = Pairs.ID1 AND H2.ID = Pairs.ID2 AND H1.name < H2.name
