Find names and grades of students who only have friends in the same grade. Return the result sorted by grade, then by name within each grade.

....好难


solution on github:

SELECT name, grade FROM Highschooler
WHERE ID NOT IN (
SELECT DISTINCT H1.ID
FROM Highschooler H1, Friend F, Highschooler H2
WHERE H1.ID = F.ID1 AND H2.ID = F.ID2
AND H1.grade <> H2.grade )
ORDER BY grade, name
