For every situation where student A likes student B, but student B likes a different student C, return the names and grades of A, B, and C. 



稍微思考了一下，应该要用三个relation 直接看了答案：
SELECT HA.name, HA.grade, HB.name, HB.grade, HC.name, HC.grade
FROM Highschooler HA, Likes LikesAB, Highschooler HB, Likes LikesBC, Highschooler HC
WHERE HA.ID = LikesAB.ID1 AND LikesAB.ID2 = HB.ID
AND HB.ID = LikesBC.ID1 AND LikesBC.ID2 = HC.ID
AND HA.ID <> HC.ID
