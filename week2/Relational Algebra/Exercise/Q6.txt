Find all pizzas that are eaten only by people younger than 24, or that cost less than $10 everywhere they're served. 


第一次答案
	(\project_{pizza} (\select_{age<24} person \join eats)) \union (\project_{pizza} (\select_{price<10} serves));

仔细看发现：
	不同的pizzeria里面的price是不一样的！！因此会多

(\project_{pizza}Eats \diff \project_{pizza}\select_{age>=24}(Person \join Eats))
	\union
(\project_{pizza}Serves \diff \project_{pizza}\select_{price >=10}Serves);
