Find all pizzerias that serve every pizza eaten by people over 30. 
(This query is very challenging; extra congratulations if you get it right.) 

		
	
	my solution:
	\project_{pizza}(\select_{age>30} person \join eats);


	stackoverflow:

\project_{pizzeria}(Serves)
	\diff
	\project_{pizzeria}(
    (\project_{pizzeria}(Serves) 
    \cross 
    \project_{pizza}(\project_{name}(\select_{age>30}(Person))\join Eats))
    \diff
    \project_{pizzeria,pizza}(Serves)
	)
