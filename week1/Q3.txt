In this question, you are to create a DTD for a small XML data set about world countries. This data is adapted from the Mondial 3.0 database as hosted by the University of Washington, and was originally compiled by the Georg-August University of Goettingen Institute for Informatics. Each country has a name, population, and area (in sq. km). Some countries also list languages (with percentages of the population that speaks each language) and/or cities (with names and populations). The XML data is here. 

Write a DTD for the XML data set. 

Important: Do not include <!DOCTYPE countries [...]> in your DTD. Your DTD should start with <!ELEMENT countries (country*)>. 


<!ELEMENT countries (country*)>
 	<!ATTLIST country name CDATA #REQUIRED
 						population CDATA #REQUIRED
 						area CDATA #REQUIRED
 	>
<!ELEMENT country (language|city)*>
	<!ATTLIST language percentage CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ELEMENT language (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT city (name,population)>
<!ELEMENT name (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT population (#PCDATA)>
